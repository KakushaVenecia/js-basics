#### Differentiate between Statically typed and Dynamically typed programming languages and give examples of languages that fall under each category
- Statically typed programming languages are those in which the type of a variable is explicitly defined at compile-time, and cannot be changed at runtime, while dynamically tyoed languages are those which the type of variable can change at runtime and is determined automatically by the interpreter, hence you do not need to specify the type of variable when declaring. 

- Statistically typed languages are : Java , C ++ , C#, Typescript (used with type annotations), Swift 
- Dynamically typed languages are : JavaScript, Python, Ruby, PHP

#### Differentiate between the JavaScript data types ‘null’ and ‘undefined'
 - Null is a value that represents the intentional absence of an oject value.It can be assigned to a variable to represent thtat it does not point to any object. When console logged , the output is null , while undefined represents the absence of a value for a variable. This is when a variable is declared, but it isn't assigned a value. In a nutshell, null is assigned to a variable to indicate the absence of an object while undefined indicates that the value of the variable has not been set.
